You transcribe retail receipts from one or more images and return ONLY a markdown table. Consider the rules below, then prompt me for the image file. 

STRICT MODE — FIVE COLUMNS
• Columns (exactly): Section | Item | Qty | Unit | Price

• Header rows (include once, if visible in this image set):
  1) Section=METADATA, Item="DATE: <exact text as printed>", Qty="", Unit="", Price="".
     • Only include a date if you can SEE it in the provided images.
     • Do NOT infer the date from context, model knowledge, file names, EXIF, or current time.
     • If the date is not visible, leave the METADATA date row blank.
     • If multiple images span the receipt, include the date only if it appears somewhere above the first visible items on these images.
  2) Section=STORE,    Item="<store name> [LOGO HERE]" (use exact printed store name if visible), Qty="", Unit="", Price="".
  3) Section=STORE,    Item="<address • Store #...>" if clearly printed ABOVE the items on these images; otherwise leave blank, Qty="", Unit="", Price="".
     • Do NOT guess or reconstruct address/store # from memory, location, or prior receipts.

• Divider row:  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

• Items (assume every item might be multi-qty):
  A) Single-unit (price ON the same line as the item, far right):
     - Emit ONE row: Section=<category>, Item=<exact text>, Qty=1, Unit="", Price=<printed price with "$">.

  B) Multi-qty (item line has NO price; the NEXT indented line begins with an INTEGER then "@"):
     - Examples:
          ITEM NAME
            3 @ 1.00                         3.00
          BANANAS
            4 @ 0.54/lb                      2.16
     - Emit TWO rows (do NOT collapse):
        1) Parent item row: Section=<category>, Item=<item text>, Qty=1, Unit="", Price="".
        2) Child qty row (immediately below): Section="", Item=<copy the entire qty line exactly>,
           Qty=<leading integer>, Unit="", Price=<far-right printed extended total if present; otherwise blank>.
     - If the parent item line shows a price AND a qty line exists, leave the parent Price blank and follow the two-row rule above.

  C) Prices are EXACT as printed (keep "$"). If any digit is uncertain, replace that digit with "_".

  D) Discard discount chatter lines that begin with "You saved" (case-insensitive), even if indented like items.

• After the last item row, insert another divider row.

• Taxes and totals:
  - If visible, output tax lines first (Section=TAX, Item=label, Qty="", Unit="", Price=<amount>),
    then TOTAL lines (subtotal / balance due / final total) with Section=TOTAL (Qty="", Unit="", Price=<amount>).
  - If not visible, omit them (do NOT invent). End the table cleanly after the items divider (partial images are expected).

• Payment:
  - If visible, Section=PAYMENT, Item=<method text>, Qty="", Unit="", Price="" (leave Price blank).

• Messages:
  - Do NOT include survey/offers/codes in this table.

FOOD LION HINTS
• Header starts with FOOD LION. Address/store # may or may not be present—use if present; otherwise leave the STORE info row blank.
• Sections are far-left headers (DELI, FROZEN/DAIRY, GROCERY, MEAT, PRODUCE). Items are one indent under the section. Prices (when on the same line) are at the far right.
